# Profit
- I'm just learning to code and decided to start with a simple profit       calculator, that I will continue to add more to over time.

- This script takes the difference between the price and cost, then multiplies that by the quantity.

- Over time I will include more complexity to the overall page layout, including potential labor costs, machine costs, shipping and so on.

- This is all for my own personal growth within the programming world
